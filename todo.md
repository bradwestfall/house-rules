- `check` of any() does a `if (value === '') return`. Maybe this should be open to more options like null
- sandbox, get rid of examples
- I don't know how to fail float, because if something passes numeric, how could it fail float

- why does it not matter than I can set the numeric type to be 'numericX' and all the tests still pass
